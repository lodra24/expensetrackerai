## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Decisions & Best Practices

This project was engineered not just to work, but to be robust, secure, and maintainable, demonstrating key principles of modern web development.

1.  **Server-First Approach with Next.js App Router:**
    The application leverages Server Components for optimal performance. All data fetching and mutations are handled securely on the server using **Server Actions**, simplifying the codebase by co-locating backend logic with the components that use it.

2.  **Robust Multi-Tenancy Security:**
    The application ensures strict data isolation. All database operations in server actions like `deleteRecord.ts` explicitly include a `where: { userId }` clause. This guarantees that a user can **only ever access or modify their own data**.

3.  **End-to-End Type Safety & Server-Side Validation:**
    Leveraging TypeScript, Prisma, and Zod, the application is type-safe from the database schema to the UI. As seen in `addExpenseRecord.ts`, all incoming data is rigorously validated on the server, ensuring database integrity.

4.  **Performance-Oriented Data Fetching:**
    The main dashboard requires multiple data points. In `getUserRecord.ts`, these distinct database queries are executed concurrently using `Promise.all`. This parallelization **minimizes server response times** and improves the initial page load experience.

5.  **Polished & Performant User Experience (UX):**
    - **Responsive UI with Pending States:** Actions like deleting a record provide immediate visual feedback (e.g., loading spinners), clearly communicating system status.
    - **Comprehensive State Handling:** The UI meticulously handles loading (with skeleton loaders), error, and empty states across all data-driven components.
    - **FOUC Prevention:** A critical inline script in `RootLayout.tsx` sets the theme _before_ the page renders, completely eliminating the jarring "Flash of Unstyled Content".

## üß† A Deeper Look at the AI Integration

The "AI" in ExpenseTracker AI is more than a buzzword; it's a carefully implemented feature focusing on utility, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

- **Cost-Effective Model Selection:** The AI integration leverages **OpenRouter** to access high-performance yet free-to-use models. This demonstrates an understanding of managing LLM costs in a real-world scenario, prioritizing efficiency without sacrificing quality.
- **Structured Output via Prompt Engineering:** Prompts, especially for generating insights in `getAIInsights.ts`, are meticulously engineered to request **structured JSON** output. This ensures predictable, parsable responses from the LLM, making the integration robust and preventing runtime errors.
- **Graceful Fallbacks:** The system is designed for resilience. If the AI service is unavailable or fails, as seen in `getAIInsights.ts`, the application gracefully falls back to a default state, ensuring the user experience is never broken.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lodra24/expensetrackerai.git
    cd expensetracker-ai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example`. Fill in the required API keys.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4.  **Sync database schema:**

    ```bash
    npx prisma db push
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üß™ Testing

- **Linting:** The project is configured with ESLint to enforce consistent coding standards (`npm run lint`).
- **Architectural Resilience:** While this project does not yet have a dedicated test suite, the server-first architecture with strong typing and server-side validation inherently reduces a significant class of bugs. Critical server actions are rigorously validated with Zod, acting as a first line of defense for data integrity.
- **Future Work:** The roadmap includes implementing unit tests with Jest and end-to-end tests with Playwright.
